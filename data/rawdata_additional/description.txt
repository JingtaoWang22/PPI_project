Yeast database from STRING:
4932.protein.links.v11.0.txt
4932.protein.sequences.v11.0.fa
parser: parse_yeast.py (can change the parameter regarding confidence and n(negative) vs. n(positive)
Filtered to get only positive interaction with confidence > 0.999
To create negative dataset: sampled randomly from the interacting proteins which are not interacting; n(negative) = n(positive)
